# Touch-Board-Workshops

![Tinfoil Theremin activity](TinFoilThereminWorkshop.png)

- [Download the workshop activity as a PDF here](TinFoilThereminWorkshop.pdf)
- [Download the associated gesture cards here](TouchBoardCards.pdf)

These activities use an Arduino sketch called TinFoilTheremin available within the repository.

If you're already familiar with the Arduino platform and have a Touch Board, you can download the sketch from the green link above (clone/download repo, and unzip).  You will also need to install the Bare Conductive package here: https://www.bareconductive.com/make/setting-up-arduino-with-your-touch-board/

Everyone else: please watch this space for better instructions! I'm in the process of uploading about ten years of work to GitHub, and it's taking time ;)
